AcquisitionGui
==============

Matlab program for simultaneous recording bird song and other signals.  Recording can be started and stoped via automatic song detection.

Requires a data acquisition card compatible with Matlab. Tested using a National Instruments card.

The program has not been used for several years -- don't remember all the features.  Happy to answer questions.
